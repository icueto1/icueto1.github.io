      <h2>Code of silence</h2>
        <p>A key eyewitness, fearful of retribution, said he will not testify in a Miami murder case even though he knows who committed the killing and it isn’t the man who is serving a life sentence for it.</p>
        <p>Arnold Clark told prosecutors in a recent deposition that he stood by his story, which he first gave in a 2015 interview with The Medill Justice Project and later confirmed in an affidavit filed by the defendant’s attorney. Defense investigators had trouble finding Clark, who went by the nickname “Maniac.” But when The Medill Justice Project identified and tracked him down, Clark, the former bouncer and floor manager of a club in Liberty City, said he witnessed what happened in 2005 when a man was shot and killed near the club.</p>

      <h2>Financial aid office gives students a run for their money</h2>
        <p>Eric Calero went through his freshman year at the University of Miami on what he thought was a full scholarship. He majored in finance and was involved in the Association of Commuter Students and the Federación de Estudiantes Cubanos.</p>
        <p>Three days before his sophomore year, Calero checked his CaneLink account and discovered that the financial aid package he was expecting had decreased by $16,100. In the following days, Calero was told he either had to pay the difference by the tuition deadline or transfer.</p>
        <p>He now attends Florida International University, where he is enrolled in several classes that are unrelated to his major and will likely graduate a semester late.</p>

      <h2>Sugar-coated lifestyle: 'Sugar babies' seek way to keep up with Miami standard</h2>
        <p>In 2008, both of Julia’s* parents lost their jobs during the Recession. She was 13 at the time and remembers her family monitoring how much they were spending, even on food.</p>
        <p>When she came to the University of Miami from New Jersey and began to realize how the cost of Uber rides and weekend outings add up, she needed extra money. So she turned to what her friends were using, something she was “very morally against” but now considers a worthwhile opportunity: sugar dating.</p>

        <h2>Going 'home' to a place they've never been: Cuba</h2>
          <p>For a lot of first-generation Cuban-Americans, Cuba is almost a myth. Grandparents talk about it at family gatherings, always insisting the music, the beaches and even the sugar was better there.</p>
          <p>For the first time in their lives, a group of Cuban-Americans got to make their own associations with the island and retrace their ancestors' steps on a CubaOne Foundation literary trip to the country.</p>

          <h2>Bayside prayers: South Florida's faith groups make Biscayne Bay their place of worship</h2>
            <p>Living in the tropics changes daily habits. Events, hobbies and activities that would be done indoors in other places are done outside in the South Florida warmth, and typically not far from a body of water.</p>
            <p>This also applies to our spiritual lives.</p>
            <p>In South Florida, people from multiple religious traditions come to the waters of Biscayne Bay – an expansive body of water that runs alongside Miami’s east coast all the way to the Florida Keys - to let go of sin, regret and shame, for symbolic cleansing, to be reborn.</p>
